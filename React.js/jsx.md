# What is JSX?

JSX is a speical dialect of JS (its not HTML).

JSX allows you to use normal HTML in a JavaScript code.

Browsers dont understand JSX code.

JSX is later translated by Babel to normal JavaScript code.

2. If there is ```-```, capitalize first letter of second word
3. You don't need ```;```
4. Value should be inside ```""```
